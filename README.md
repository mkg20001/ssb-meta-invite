# ssb-meta-invite

> Meta invite page/server which grabs random invites from random pubs

## Why

Sometimes pubs are down.
Most of the time because lazy users always click the first one
in the list and then that one gets overloaded quite quickly.

Also sometimes pubs aren't really responding so generating an invite takes some time.

I created this project to make getting an invite easier and faster
